This following page 
is an example of my STEP work [see www.step.org].  Basically, I convert <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructive_solid_geometry">Constructive Solid Geometry</a> to a Facetted <a href="http://http//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_representation">Boundary Representation</a> using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_boolean_operation">Euler Boolean operations.</a>  See  
<a href="http://www.cs.hut.fi/~mam/">Mantyla</a>
, "An Introduction to Solid Modelling" and Mortenson's "Geometric 
Modeling", and several papers by Greyer and Braid, (see Braid, Hillyard,
 Stroud "Stepwise construction of polyhedra in geomeric modeling",  
Mathematical methods in computer graphics and design, p123-141 AP, 
London, 1980), and www.spatial.com's ACIS documentation for more 
details.

Here </a> is the class hierarchy for my project.<br>
Following the technalink link, you will get a dialog box asking to allow
 the installation of an ActiveX control from TechnaSales.  You must 
select "Yes" to allow the installation of this executable on your hard 
disk.  The ActiveX control is very much like MS Media Player.  We are 
working on an C#/.NET version of this component, but that is a big 
undertaking.  Mostly, the GUI will be in C#, but not the conversion 
engine.
<a href="http://www.technalink.com/vdist/iraro/iraro1.html">
http://www.technalink.com/vdist/iraro/iraro1.html</a><br>select 
"series An" button<br>on the next scene, "Provnair Series" select "Draw 
Part"<br>click the icon of the floppy, 2nd row, third from last.<br>save as 
<br>iraro.stp<br> (Make sure that you chose the first pull down selection STEP Faceted *.stp).  It takes a while for the file to appear.<br>You should get a 
<a href="https://wheger.tripod.com/step/iraro.stp">output file</a> like 
this.<br>&nbsp;Now you need to be able to read a step formatted 
file.<br>This means that you need to a CAD STEP viewer like SolidEdge, 
SolidWorks, Catia, AutoCAD.<br>If you don't have one of those, you can download 
a trial viewer from a couple of sites.&nbsp; Go to www.google.com and search for 
CAD viewers STEP<br>You can use what I used for testing, e.g. WiseView32 from 
<br><a href="http://www.wiseview.com/">http://www.wiseview.com/</a><br>or 
<br>Download the <a href="http://216.95.183.86/downloads/v17_1c1/Eng/avsolpdemo.exe">AutoVue 
viewer</a> from http://www.cimmetry.com ! <br> <a href="http://www.opencascade.org/">OpenCascade</a> is a free CAD tool for non-commercial work.  Example <a href="https://wheger.tripod.com/step/iraro.stp">faceted representation step 
format</a> <br>and <a href="https://wheger.tripod.com/step/instrux_sep13g.stp">Advanced BREP step 
format</a> <br> or <a href="https://wheger.tripod.com/step/csg.stp">CSG step
